Chatter is a small weekend project created by [Streets Ahead LLC](http://streetsaheadllc.com).  It is a very basic chat server written in Node.js.  It was our first attempt at building a real application with Node and WebSockets.  You can check it out at [http://chatterapp.info](http://chatterapp.info).
